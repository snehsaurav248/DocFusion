### ðŸš€ **DocFusion API Documentation**  

I am building **DocFusion**, a **powerful document scanning and matching system** with a built-in **credit system** to manage user scans efficiently.  
Each user gets **20 free scans daily**, and once exhausted, they must request additional credits, which **admins can approve or deny**.  
The platform provides **seamless document processing, intelligent text matching, and insightful analytics** for effective document management.
