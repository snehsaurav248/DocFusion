if i talk about the hobbies i like to play physical sports like cricket and badminton in my free times which keeps my health and my mental peace all together and also in my free times i like to read the self help books which has significantly helped me to be on right track personally and professionally.




Bookshelf Exchange App is a platform designed to simplify buying, selling, and exchanging textbooks and course materials. It connects students in a community where they can list, browse, and trade books effortlessly.

The reason for making this App is to make it accessible to those students who can't afford the books at mrp price 
But from this platform, they can easily get those books at affordable prices.

If i TALK about the tech stacks then :-

Frontend: Built with React.js for dynamic UI,
Tailwind CSS for modern styling, and Redux for state management.

Backend: I used  Node.js and Express.js, implementing JWT for secure authentication and authorization.

Data Management: Utilizes MongoDB for scalable, document-based storage with Mongoose for smooth database interactions.






Kanban Board is a project developed using React and Firebase Firestore, enabling users to manage tasks across various stages (TODO, IN PROGRESS, COMPLETED). The app provides an intuitive interface for task creation, editing, and deletion, allowing users to track and update tasks with ease.

Frontend: Built with React for a dynamic, component-based architecture, leveraging React Beautiful DnD for drag-and-drop functionality. The UI is enhanced using Tailwind CSS for responsive design and modern styling.
Backend: Integrated with Firebase Firestore for real-time, cloud-based data storage and synchronization, allowing users to access and manage tasks across devices.

Features:
Task creation, editing, and deletion
Drag-and-drop for task status changes (TODO, IN PROGRESS, COMPLETED)
Real-time updates and synchronization across users
Fully responsive UI, ensuring smooth usability on desktop and mobile devices

Talking about the books then 

The Alchemist

The Alchemist is a novel by Brazilian author Paulo Coelho. It tells the story of Santiago, a young shepherd, who embarks on a journey to find a hidden treasure. Along the way, he learns valuable life lessons, discovering the importance of following one's dreams and listening to one's heart. The novel explores themes of destiny, self-discovery, and the interconnectedness of life. The Alchemist is widely regarded as a motivational and philosophical tale about pursuing personal legends and realizing one’s true potential.


Here are a few powerful statements from David Goggins' books, along with situations from his life:

1. "You are stopping you, you are giving up instead of getting hard."  
   - This statement reflects his experience of pushing through intense pain and discomfort during his Navy SEAL training. In *Can't Hurt Me*, Goggins recalls how, during Hell Week, he pushed through exhaustion, cold, and physical injuries, realizing that the only thing holding him back was his own mindset.

2. **"The most important conversation you’ll ever have is the one you have with yourself."**  
   - Goggins emphasizes the importance of self-talk, especially when facing adversity. He shares how, during his ultra-endurance races, he fought through mental barriers by controlling his inner dialogue, teaching himself to keep going despite extreme fatigue and pain.

3. **"Suffering is the true test of life."**  
   - In *Can't Hurt Me*, Goggins talks about how suffering has been a consistent part of his life, from his troubled childhood to his grueling military training. He describes how he transformed suffering into growth, using it as a tool to push himself beyond perceived limits.

4. **"The cookie jar"**  
   - Goggins introduces the concept of the "cookie jar" as a mental strategy. He recalls a time when he was running a race and was about to give up. He mentally dipped into his "cookie jar" of past victories and hardships, recalling the challenges he had overcome, which motivated him to keep going.

5. **"Get comfortable being uncomfortable."**  
   - Goggins describes his experience of running ultra-marathons, sometimes in extreme conditions. He learned to embrace discomfort rather than shy away from it. This mindset helped him push through physical pain and emerge stronger, both mentally and physically.

Each of these statements encapsulates Goggins' philosophy of resilience, mental toughness, and the refusal to give in to adversity.
